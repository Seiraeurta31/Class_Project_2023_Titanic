                        “Titanic” director James Cameron finally conceded that Jack “might have” survived the sinking of the cruise ship if he shared Rose’s makeshift raft, settling a decades-long debate among some fans of the blockbuster 1997 film.

                        We all know the story of Titanic – the making of James Cameron’s Titanic, that is. The $200 million production, released in December 1997, was perhaps the most ambitious film of its time. The enormous project incorporated a dive to the wreck of the real ship by the director, full-scale sinkable sets constructed in a massive purpose-built water tank, large-scale practical effects,

                        Twenty-five years ago today, the film Titanic premiered in the US, quickly taking the world by storm with its fictional retelling of the luxury liner’s tragedy. At the time, it was the most expensive movie ever made, with a $200 million budget, and the first film ever to bring in over $1 billion, eventually grossing just over $2 billion. Titanic director James Cameron eventually dethroned himself with his film Avatar in 2010, which went on to gross roughly $2.8 billion.

## Quynh's challenges

While creating the layout, I found that the main challenges was finding the optimal cut off for responsive screens and making sure the website is still looking consistent with the responsive screens. I think some of the other minor challenges for me were adjusting the banner cover photo to a specific coordinate so that the users can see the main focus of the banner, and making sure it remains the main focus of the photo even in various browsers and responsive screens. My other minor challenge was when I created the first version of the title with subtitle underneath for the layout, the display I had created a larger line gap than I wanted, so it took some time to move it around and play with the padding and the margin. Since we learned CSS grid around the time of the project, it made creating the layout (header, nav, body, footer) a lot easier than if I were to use flex box.

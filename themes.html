                <p class="about__text"> Although much of the action in the film revolves around the budding romance of Rose DeWitt Bukater and Jack Dawson, Titanic: The Movie has a lot more to the eye than what is shown on the surface. Underneath it all, the movie offers a rich experience of intriguing symbolism and thematic imagery that captivate fans and casual movie-goers alike.

            <h3 class="about">Love</h3>
            <p>“It’s (Titanic) a slave ship taking me back to America, in chains.” — Rose DeWitt Bukater</p>

            <img src="/themesimage/iwontletgo.webp" alt="Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater respectively.">

            <p>Love is a concurrent theme in the film and is a central position for the main character, Rose DeWitt Bukater. Rose throughout the film consistently flirts with the concept of two contrasting, different types of love. At the beginning of it, she is shown to be unhappy in her engagement to Caledon “Cal” Hockley. So unhappy, Rose elects to attempt suicide by jumping off the back of the boat. Cal comes from a wealthy background in his family and is on the Titanic with Rose to marry her in her hometown of Philadelphia, PA. Rose’s family, albeit also aristocratic, have squandered much of the family’s wealth due to bad investments. Cal knows this and is continually using her situation to take advantage of Rose. In the film, we see Cal abusing Rose in various scenes, only to give her expensive gifts and love-bomb her in return. The most expensive gift was “The Heart of the Ocean.” A sapphire necklace encrusted with diamonds in the film was worn by King Louis XIV of France.</p>

            <img src="/themesimage/heartoftheocean.png" alt="Heart of The Ocean">

            <p>Fun Fact: The Heart of the Ocean is not an actual stone. Eight thousand USD was commissioned to make it for the movie. If the stone were made as it is shown in the movie, its worth would be well over three hundred million USD. The story is either The Heart of The Ocean was based on the hope diamond that was a sapphire stone formerly owned by King Louis XIV or was based on a necklace given as a gift from one of the actual onboard passengers to his mistress when they boarded Titanic to start a new life together in America. While both passengers secretly eloped on the ship, the mistress was the only one to have survived, although she did end up becoming pregnant with his child weeks after the sinking of the ship and the passing of her love.</p>

            <p>“He saved me in every way a person can be saved.” - Rose DeWitt Bukater</p>

            <p>While being succumbed to the circumstances of the first class, Rose is entertaining the courtship of a lower-class individual on the ship named Jack. Jack had saved Rose from wanting to off herself in the film and begins a romance with her that defied all odds. Jack’s easy-going, adventurous nature brings out an energy in Rose that isn’t reflected in her controlling relationship with her fiancée. From hocking loogies into the ocean to dancing Irish jigs with each other to having Jack paint Rose as one of his French girls, Rose feels free with Jack and chooses to eventually run away with him when the Titanic docked in New York. Jack’s short time with Rose allowed her to learn how she wants to be loved. Rose wound up having the life Jack said she would, a long life filled with happiness, a bunch of kids, and one-of-a-kind experiences. </p>

            <h3 class="about">Opportunity</h3>
            <p>"When You Got Nothing, You Got Nothing to Lose" - Jack Dawson</p>

            <img src="/themesimage/poker.jpg" alt="Jack gambling for Titanic tickets.">

            <p>The Titanic for many is seen as an opportunity for many individuals in the movie. Many of the film’s passengers onboard had wanted to use the voyage to better themselves and their lives. At the beginning of the film, we see Jack Dawson and his friend Fabrizio De Rossi gamble with two Swedish individuals for tickets aboard the Titanic. Jack Dawson in the film is a homeless orphan who wanders place to place in order to survive. Even sleeping under a bridge the night before boarding the Titanic. The Titanic had offered Jack and Fabrizio stability in their lives, and unknowingly the chance for Jack to meet the love of his life.</p>

            <p>Fun Fact: The early 1900s saw unprecedented immigration from various European nations to the United States. Up to fifteen million European immigrants came to Ellis Island in New York from 1900-1915. The real Titanic housed passengers of all classes who had wanted to escape famine, persecution, or clashing social norms to make a new name for themselves in the land of opportunity. </p>

            <p>“Of course it's unfair. We're women. Our choices are never easy.” - Ruth DeWitt Bukater</p>

            <p>Ruth DeWitt, Rose’s Mother, is another example of using the voyage of the titanic to further her ambitions. As we have discussed earlier, Ruth’s former husband had squandered much of their family’s wealth before his passing. As Ruth would prefer to continue the lifestyle she is accustomed to, she has urged her daughter to see through the arranged marriage with Cal regardless of her true feelings to continue being rich. Ruth also wants her daughter to grant every single one of her fiancée's wishes and keep up the image of being high class in doing so. Needless to say, Ruth grows to resent her daughter the more she engages with the lower-class scoundrel in Jack Dawson. </p>

            <h3 class="about">Pride</h3>
            <p>“It is unsinkable. God himself could not sink this ship.” — Caledon (Cal) Hockley</p>

            <img src="/themesimage/titanicvoyage.jpg" alt="" class="theme__image3"> 

            <p>Pride is another revolving theme that exists in the movie’s universe and is interwoven in every single aspect of the film. When the Titanic departs for New York in the film. The reputation of the ship discussed by the captain, the architect, and even Rose’s fiancée describes the titanic as “unsinkable” which was the actual reputation of the titanic during its making and at the start of its voyage.</p>

            <p>While the Titanic was revolutionary in its construction, its size, and for trying to undergo one of the fastest trips ever done at that time. The egos of those in charge neglected the fact that there were severe problems that plagued the cruise liner that ultimately cost everyone everything. There was little direction concerning safety protocol, Not enough lifeboats for all the passengers, Inefficient communication across all departments working on the ship, and barely any when personnel was communicating with the passengers on board. The movie shows very well the mania that ensued in the second half of the film, as it shows that the Titanic was very much sinkable and very much costly for all who had boarded it.</p>

            <p>Fun Fact: The tragedy of the Titanic ended up revolutionizing transatlantic travel for the better. The United Kingdom and the United States opened up inquiries into the incident and ended up co-creating the international convention for the safety of life at sea, which are safety standards that are used to this very day.</p>
